    "\n",
    "The class needs to include a `forward` method that implements the forward pass through the network. In this method, you pass some input tensor `x` through each of the operations you defined earlier. The `torch.nn` module also has functional equivalents for things like ReLUs in `torch.nn.functional`. This module is usually imported as `F`. Then to use a ReLU activation on some layer (which is just a tensor), you'd do `F.relu(x)`. Below are a few different commonly used activation functions.\n",
